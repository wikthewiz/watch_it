watch_it
========

A Linux tool for executing a command on read or open of a file. 


IDE
===========

You can use any IDE but I've used eclipse and has therefore included the eclipse projectfiles.

Build
=====

 To build run: `make all`
 
 To start run: `./watch_it`

Logging
=======
Logging will be done in syslog under watch_it. For more info on syslog run: `man syslog` or take a look [here](http://www.precision-guesswork.com/sage-guide/syslog-overview.html "syslog") 

Config
======

To use this application you need a config file named `watch_it.conf` in `/etc`:
```
	/etc/watch_it.conf
```
Here is the list of config options and a short desription:


| command       | description |
|---------------|:------------|
|warch_it       | Holds a list of folders to watch| 
|fire_on        | Is the list of events to fire. `OPEN` or `CLOSE`|
|min_read_close| Is the minimum time in milliseconds between read and close events that must elapse before firing `open_command`|
|recursive      |  Is a boolean telling if we should recursivle watch all under folders|
|open_command   | The command to execute on `OPEN`. `@0` will be replaced with the file that triggerd the event|
|close_command  | The command to execute on `CLOSE`. `@0` will be replaced with the file that triggerd the event|

And here is an example `/etc/watch_it.conf`:
```ini
	# Each rule in [folder] will be applied on watch _ir.
	# To apply change changes, you must restart watch_it
	# ; - is a comment and will not be read

	[folder]
	
	# The comma seperated list of directories to watch.
	watch_dir="/path/to/test, /path/to/test2" 


	# can be any of 
	#    OPEN	this will fire once on starting to read or write
	#	 CLOSE 
	fire_on="OPEN|CLOSE"

	# min_read_close is the minimum time in milliseconds between read and a close
	# event that must elapse before firing an open event. This is because when 
	# just open an directory all files are read and then close. So if you want 
	# these events as well you must set this to 0. Also when open a text document
	# it is not continual held open therefor it will not fire any open events if
	# this is something other then 0.
	# Example:
	#  A file is read and close in under min_read_close -> This will not fire
	min_read_close=200 ; time in milleseconds

	recursive=true ; if set to true it will recursively watch all contents

	# open_command is the command that will be called on open. @0 will be replaced
	# with the file or dir that triggered to event
	open_command=echo "this is echo open @0"    ; command called on open
	close_command=echo "this is echo! close @0" ; command called on close
```

This is work in progress more to come

 * TODO: Autoconfig
 * Coming soon: python wrapper for 
  	`record start` and `record stop`
