# min_read_close is the minimum time in milliseconds between read and a close
# event that must elapse before firing an open event. This is because when 
# just open an directory all files are read and then close. So if you want 
# these events as well you must set this to 0. Also when open a text document
# it is not continual held open therefor it will not fire any open events if
# this is something other then 0.
# Example:
#  A file is read and close in under min_read_close -> This will not fire
min_read_close=200 ; time in milleseconds

recursive=true ; if set to true it will recursively watch all contents

# open_command is the command that will be called on open. @0 will be replaced
# with the file or dir that triggered to event
open_command=echo "this is echo open @0"    ; command called on open
close_command=echo "this is echo! close @0" ; command called on close
